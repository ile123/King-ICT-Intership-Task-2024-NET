- **How to configure the db**
  Open the terminal in the solution root directory, and type the following command:
  `sudo docker compose -f product_db.yml -p product up --build`
  This will run the docker compose file and it will create the db. The compose file is located in the solution root directory.
  In order to create the tables for the db run the following commands(these following commands where generated by JetBrains Rider):
  ```
    1. dotnet ef migrations add --project Api/Api.csproj --startup-project Api/Api.csproj --context Api.Data.AppDbContext --configuration Debug <name_of_migration> --output-dir Migrations
    2. dotnet ef database update --project Api/Api.csproj --startup-project Api/Api.csproj --context Api.Data.AppDbContext --configuration Debug <name_of_migration>
  ```
  In order to run the solution, enter the Api project and run the following command:
  `dotnet run`
- **Authentication and authorizatin**
  As of now, there are no user based authentication and authorization, instead there is a endpoint(*api/Auth/get-token*) that generates a JWT token and returns it. The token is necessary in order to be able to call the rest of the endpoints.
- **Testing the application**
  There are two ways:
   - By calling the *api/Product/fetch-data-from-api* endpoint and storing the products to the db and testing the endpoints using a api development tool(like Postman or Yaak)
   - Unit tests(not yet implemented)
